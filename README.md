Prodigy Infotech – Task 01: Data Visualization

This repository contains my submission for Task 01 of the Data Science Internship at Prodigy Infotech. Through this task, I explored data visualization techniques using a real-world population dataset from the World Bank.

📌 Task Overview
Objective:
Create visual representations (bar charts, histograms, etc.) to understand the distribution of population data across different countries and over time.

Learning Outcome:
This task enhanced my practical understanding of data visualization and helped me uncover meaningful insights from raw datasets using Python.

Internship Goal:
I’m participating in this internship to:

Gain real-world experience

Build a strong portfolio

Deepen my knowledge in data science and analytics
